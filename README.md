# 🪐 NASA Exoplanet Explorer

A full-stack web application that lets you query **6,000+ confirmed exoplanets** from NASA's official Exoplanet Archive — built using AI-assisted development with React and Node.js.

## 🤖 About This Project

This project was built as a demonstration of **AI-assisted software development** — a workflow where a developer uses AI tools (like Claude) to plan, architect, debug, and build a real-world application, while maintaining full understanding and ownership of every decision.

This is not just "AI generated code" — it's a structured collaboration where:

- **I defined the requirements** — what to build, what data to use, what UX problems to solve
- **I made architectural decisions** — in-memory caching vs database, fallback strategy, component structure
- **I directed the AI** — with specific prompts for each piece, reviewed every output, and caught issues
- **I debugged real problems** — NASA's API went down mid-build, I identified the issue, chose the fallback strategy, and implemented it
- **I understood the tradeoffs** — why text input for hostname but dropdown for year, why 500 result limit, why local CSV backup

> *"The AI writes faster than I can type — but I decide what gets written and why."*

This workflow reflects exactly how modern software teams are integrating AI tools — not replacing developers, but making them significantly more productive.

## ✨ Features

- 🔭 **4 search filters** — Discovery Year, Method, Host Star, Facility
- ⚡ **Instant search** — data cached in memory on startup, no DB needed
- 🔄 **Smart data loading** — tries NASA API first, falls back to local CSV automatically
- 📊 **Sortable results table** — click any column header to sort ▲▼
- 🔗 **NASA planet links** — click any planet name to open its official NASA page
- 🛡️ **Result limiting** — caps at 500 rows to prevent browser freeze
- 📈 **Stats bar** — shows live counts of years, methods, stars and facilities
- 🌌 **Dark space theme** — animated starfield background

## 🧠 AI-Assisted Development — What This Means

### What I prompted the AI to do:
- Generate boilerplate Express server structure
- Write the CSV parsing logic
- Suggest component breakdown for the React frontend
- Write initial CSS for the dark space theme

### What I decided and directed:
- Chose in-memory caching over a database (faster, simpler for this use case)
- Identified the hostname dropdown UX problem (5000+ options unusable) and chose text input with autocomplete as the solution
- Caught the NASA API failure mid-build, diagnosed it as a server-side Oracle DB error, and designed the fallback strategy
- Chose `pscomppars` table over `ps` table after understanding the difference (unique planets vs multiple measurements)
- Decided 500 row display limit after reasoning about browser performance
- Structured the README to reflect honest AI collaboration

### Key insight:
Working effectively with AI tools requires strong **prompt engineering**, **critical thinking**, and **domain understanding**. You can't just say "build me an app" — you need to break problems down, review outputs carefully, catch errors, and make informed decisions at every step.

## 🏗 Architecture

```
NASA API (live)
      │
      ├── ✅ Available → load fresh data
      └── ❌ Down → fallback to local CSV
                │
                ▼
         Node.js Backend
         (data cached in memory)
                │
         ┌──────┴──────┐
         │             │
    /options       /search
    (dropdowns)   (filtered results)
         │             │
         └──────┬──────┘
                ▼
         React Frontend
    (query panel + results table)
```

**Why in-memory caching?**
Data is loaded once on server startup and stored as a JavaScript array. Every search is a `.filter()` on that array — no database, no repeated API calls. Results return in milliseconds.

**Why the CSV fallback?**
NASA's API occasionally goes down for maintenance or blocks requests. The local CSV ensures the app always works regardless of NASA's uptime. This was a real problem encountered during development and solved deliberately.
